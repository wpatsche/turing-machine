  # Exercises:

  # • Suppose a ledger starts from 0 and gains one dollar for each +
  #   and loses one for each -. Reading left to right,
  #   check that the account never goes into the negative.
  #   Examples: accept '+-++' and '++-+--', reject '-++' and '++---+'.

  # • Check parentheses for proper nesting,
  #   e.g. accept '()(()()())' but reject '(()))(' and '(()('.
